# Towers of Hanoi Simulation

## Overview
This mini-project simulates the Towers of Hanoi game using an array-based stack template class called Stackt. The objective is to move a set of disks from one peg to another following specific rules.

## Contents
1. **Stackt Class:** An array-based stack template class implementation is provided to represent the pegs and their disk contents.
2. **Towers of Hanoi Program:** This program utilizes the Stackt class to simulate the Towers of Hanoi game. It implements the recursive algorithm provided to solve the problem efficiently.
3. **Documentation:** Comments within the code provide explanations of the implementation details and the algorithm used.
4. **Execution Instructions:** Guidelines for compiling and executing the program.
5. **Game Demonstration:** Instructions on how to run the program and visualize the Towers of Hanoi simulation.
6. **End of the Universe Calculation:** Theoretical calculation of when the universe will end if one move takes one second, based on the legend of the Tower of Brahma.

## Execution Instructions
1. Compile the program using the appropriate compiler for your system.
2. Execute the compiled program.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of disks (N).
4. Observe the simulation to see each move until all disks have been moved from peg A to peg C.
5. Note the number of moves needed to complete the game.

## Game Demonstration
1. Upon running the program, you will be prompted to input the number of disks (N).
2. The program will then simulate the Towers of Hanoi game, displaying each move and the current state of the pegs.
3. The simulation continues until all disks have been successfully moved to peg C.
4. Finally, the program outputs the total number of moves required to complete the game.

## End of the Universe Calculation
According to legend, the Tower of Brahma comprises 64 gold disks on 3 diamond needles. It is said that the Universe will end when this task is completed. Assuming one move takes one second, the theoretical time for the universe to end can be calculated by multiplying the total number of moves required to complete the game by one second.

## Conclusion
This mini-project provides an implementation of the Towers of Hanoi game using an array-based stack template class. It offers an opportunity to understand recursive algorithms and data structure concepts while simulating an intriguing mathematical puzzle. Additionally, it explores the fascinating legend surrounding the Tower of Brahma and its supposed implications for the end of the universe.
